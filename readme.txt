== Description ==

Generate revenue from every single person that views your content **($.90 per USA visitor is the current average)**, using AdLock速 from Adscend Media. This plugin allows you to easily implement the AdLock service, and select which posts to apply it to. Visitors to the selected pages will need to unlock the page content by completing a short sponsored action.

You must have an Adscend Media publisher account in order to use this plugin. If you do not yet have one, [apply here](https://adscendmedia.com/apply.php).
Founded in 2009, Adscend Media is a leader in the online advertising space, focused on developing innovative, turn-key digital content monetization solutions.
